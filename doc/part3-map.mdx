# Incremental tutorial, Part 3; Incr_map

In [Part 2](./part2-dynamic.mdx), we discussed how to use `bind` for
building dynamic computations, as well as some of the downsides. In
particular, bind-based dynamism tends to have poor incremental
performance.

Happily, there are companion libraries for Incremental that make it
easier to deal with dynamic data sets in a more efficient way.  In
particular, we'll discuss the `Incr_map` library, which lets you build
efficient incremental computations on top of `Map.t`'s.

To see this, let's start by creating a computation on top of maps,
first in direct style, and then see how we can improve its performance
by using Incremental.

These examples will be around sets of orders.  Let's start with some
types for describing orders.

```ocaml
open Core
module Symbol : Identifiable = String
module Dir = struct
  type t = Buy | Sell [@@deriving equal]
end
module Order = struct
  module Id : Identifiable = String
  type t =
    { sym: Symbol.t
    ; size: int
    ; price: float
    ; dir: Dir.t
    ; id : Id.t
    }
end
```

The following function is a simple, all-at-once computation that takes
a collection of orders, presented as a map indexed by order-id, and
returns the total number of shares.

```ocaml
# let shares (orders : Order.t Map.M(Order.Id).t) =
    Map.fold orders ~init:0 ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:o acc -> acc + o.size)
val shares : Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t -> int = <fun>
```

Now, let's say we want to do this incrementally, so that if a new
order is added to the map, we don't have to recompute everything.  We
could simply use the ordinary Incremental `map` operator:

```ocaml
# module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr : Incremental.S
# open Incr.Let_syntax
# let shares orders = orders >>| shares
val shares : Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

But that doesn't really help.  While this function is incremental in
its type, the incremental performance is no better than the
all-at-once computation we started with.  In particular, if the map of
orders is modified at all, the entire computation will be rerun from
scratch.

In order to do better, we want to take advantage of the fact that
maps, like many functional data structures, can be diffed efficiently.
Indeed, we have a function called `Map.symmetric_diff` that does just
that.

```ocaml
# let _ = Map.symmetric_diff;;
- : ('a, 'b, 'c) Map.t ->
    ('a, 'b, 'c) Map.t ->
    data_equal:('b -> 'b -> bool) ->
    ('a, 'b) Map.Symmetric_diff_element.t Sequence.t
= <fun>
```

But instead of using `Map.symmetric_diff` directly, we're going to use
`Incr_map`, which builds up a bunch of useful operators taking
advantage of the diffability of maps.  One such operator is
`Incr_map.unordered_fold`.  Let's first instantiate the `Incr_map` module:

```ocaml
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make(Incr);;
```

```ocaml
# let _ = Incr_map.unordered_fold;;
- : ?instrumentation:Incr_map.Instrumentation.t ->
    ?data_equal:('a -> 'a -> bool) ->
    ?update:(key:'b -> old_data:'a -> new_data:'a -> 'c -> 'c) ->
    ?specialized_initial:(init:'c -> ('b, 'a, 'd) Map.t -> 'c) ->
    ?finalize:('c -> 'c) ->
    ?revert_to_init_when_empty:bool ->
    ('b, 'a, 'd) Map.t Incr.t ->
    init:'c ->
    add:(key:'b -> data:'a -> 'c -> 'c) ->
    remove:(key:'b -> data:'a -> 'c -> 'c) -> 'c Incr.t
= <fun>
```

With `Incr_map.unordered_fold`, if you update a subset of the orders in
the map, then `add` and `remove` will be called once every time an element
is added or removed.  If an element is modified, then they'll both be
called, with `remove` followed by `add`.  There's also an optional
`update` argument that you can provide if you want to provide more
optimized behavior on a modify.

We can use it to compute our share counts:

```ocaml
# let shares orders =
    let update_shares op ~key:_ ~data:(o:Order.t) shares =
      op shares o.size
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      orders
      ~init:0
      ~add:(update_shares (+))
      ~remove:(update_shares (-))
val shares : ('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

This function now has reasonable incremental performance.

The incremental graph here is actually very simple, it's just:

```
+--------+     +--------+
| orders |---->| shares |
+--------+     +--------+
```

The optimization here doesn't come from having a graph structure that
tracks dependencies and allows us to only recompute the necessary
subset of the graph. Instead, symmetric diff is being used under the
covers to discover the differences and respond to them individually.


This might lead you to wonder why we're using Incremental at all, as
opposed to something that's more focused on just diffing. But what's
nice about this approach is it allows you to smoothly integrate
diff-based incrementality within a larger graph-based computation.

One advantage of this approach is that it's nicely composable.  For
example, if we want to compute the number of shares on the bid and
offer side, we can do that by incrementally filtering the map first.


```ocaml
# let filter_by_dir orders dir =
    Incr_map.filter_mapi orders ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:(o:Order.t) ->
      if Dir.equal dir o.dir then Some o else None)
val filter_by_dir :
  ('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t -> Dir.t -> ('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t =
  <fun>
# let shares_by_dir orders dir =
    shares (filter_by_dir orders dir)
val shares_by_dir : ('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t -> Dir.t -> int Incr.t =
  <fun>
```

The dependency graph of Incremental also serves as a means of keeping
a bunch of incremental computations in sync.  You can create multiple
different incremental computations on the same universe of inputs, and
you're guaranteed that, once you call `stabilize`, all of the
computations will be in sync with each other.

## Nested incrementality

`Incr_map` lets you do more than just string together a collection
of diff-style computations within your computation graph. It also lets
you build computations that richly integrate diff-style and
graph-style incrementality.  This turns out to make the approach more
composable.

Here's an example. Let's say you want to take the `shares` function we
computed above, and now compute the number of shares per symbol.  We
can start down this path by first converting our map of orders indexed
by order-id into a two-level map, with the outer key being symbol, and
the inner key being order id.

This is actually a quite general idea, so let's write a general
function, `index_by`, to do it.

```ocaml
# let index_by inner_comparator outer_comparator map get_outer_index =
    let add ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.update acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> Map.singleton inner_comparator key data
        | Some inner_map -> Map.set inner_map ~key ~data)
    in
    let remove ~key ~data acc =
      let idx = get_outer_index data in
      Map.change acc idx ~f:(function
        | None -> assert false
        | Some inner_map ->
          let inner_map = Map.remove inner_map key in
          if Map.is_empty inner_map then None else Some inner_map)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold map ~init:(Map.empty outer_comparator) ~add ~remove
val index_by :
  ('a, 'b) Comparator.Module.t ->
  ('c, 'd) Comparator.Module.t ->
  ('a, 'e, 'f) Map.t Incr.t ->
  ('e -> 'c) -> ('c, ('a, 'e, 'b) Map.t, 'd) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

The function takes the comparators for the inner and outer maps, an
incremental map, and a function for extracting the value we want to
use for the outer index.

Using this, we can easily write a function that takes a map of orders
and produces a two-level map, indexed by symbols on the outside and
orders on the inside.

```ocaml
# let index_by_symbol (orders : Order.t Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t)
    : Order.t Map.M(Order.Id).t Map.M(Symbol).t Incr.t =
    index_by (module Order.Id) (module Symbol) orders
      (fun (o : Order.t) -> o.sym)
val index_by_symbol :
  Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t ->
  Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t Core.Map.M(Symbol).t Incr.t = <fun>
```

Now, the rest seems easy: we already have a function for computing
shares from a map of orders: we just need to incrementally map that
over our outer, symbol map.  Here's an attempt to do just that.

```ocaml
# let shares_by_symbol orders =
    let orders_by_symbol = index_by_symbol orders in
    Incr_map.mapi orders_by_symbol ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data -> shares data)
Line 3, characters 67-71:
Error: This expression has type
         Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t =
           (Order.Id.t, Order.t, Order.Id.comparator_witness) Map.t
       but an expression was expected of type
         ('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t Incr.t =
           (('a, Order.t, 'b) Map.t, Incr.state_witness) Incremental.t
```

But this doesn't work! The problem is that `Incr_map.mapi` expects the
inner computation to be an ordinary all-at-once function, but we want
the function to itself be incremental.

Happily, `Incr_map` has another function, `Incr_map.mapi'` (you might
pronounce that "mapi prime"), that does just that.

Compare the types of each function:
```ocaml
# let _ = Incr_map.mapi
- : ?instrumentation:Incr_map.Instrumentation.t ->
    ?data_equal:('a -> 'a -> bool) ->
    ('b, 'a, 'c) Map.t Incr.t ->
    f:(key:'b -> data:'a -> 'd) -> ('b, 'd, 'c) Map.t Incr.t
= <fun>
# let _ = Incr_map.mapi'
- : ?instrumentation:Incr_map.Instrumentation.t ->
    ?cutoff:'a Incr.Cutoff.t ->
    ?data_equal:('a -> 'a -> bool) ->
    ('b, 'a, 'c) Map.t Incr.t ->
    f:(key:'b -> data:'a Incr.t -> 'd Incr.t) -> ('b, 'd, 'c) Map.t Incr.t
= <fun>
```

And using it to compute `shares_by_symbol`

```ocaml
# let shares_by_symbol orders =
    let orders_by_symbol = index_by_symbol orders in
    Incr_map.mapi' orders_by_symbol ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data -> shares data)
val shares_by_symbol :
  Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t ->
  (Symbol.t, int, Symbol.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

While the ordinary and primed version of these functions are
superficially very similar, they have very different Incremental
graphs.  While the un-primed function just gives you a simple two-node
graph, the primed version builds a dynamic graph with a number of
nodes that changes dynamically with the size of the map.  It would
look something like this:

```
            +----+         +----+
         .->| e1 |--[ f ]->| e1'|-.
        /   +----+         +----+  \
       /    +----+         +----+   \
      |  .->| e2 |--[ f ]->| e2'|-.  \
      | /   +----+         +----+  \  \
  +---+/      .              .      \  '->+---+
  | m |       .              .       '--->| m'|
  +---+       .              .      .---->+---+
       \    +----+         +----+  /
        '-->| en |--[ f ]->| en'|-'
            +----+         +----+
```

i.e., you start with some map incremental, `m`, and that gets broken
down into a collection of incrementals, `e1` through `en`, one per
entry in the map.  You then apply some other incremental
transformation, as specified by the function `f`, to produce `e1'`
through `en'`, which are then reassembled into `m'`.  If you modify
the data under a given key in `m`, it will only fire updates down the
path corresponding to that entry in the map.

Adding and removing keys from `m`, on the other hand, corresponds to
adding and removing entire paths through the graph.

## Performance questions

It's worth stopping and thinking about the performance implications of
this approach. In particular, you end up minting potentially a rather
large number of incremental nodes, and incremental nodes themselves
are pretty heavy.  A single `Incr.t` is a record with 27 fields, so
there's a solid 216 bytes just from that alone!  Plus, there's some
extra overhead for firing through the incremental nodes.

We could have built the function we described above with just a single
unordered fold, no primed operators or nested incrementality in
sight.  Here's what that would look like.

```ocaml
# let shares_per_symbol_flat (orders : Order.t Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t) =
    let update_sym_map op ~key:_ ~data:(o : Order.t) m =
      Map.update m o.sym ~f:(function
        | None -> o.size
        | Some x -> op x o.size)
    in
    Incr_map.unordered_fold
      orders
      ~init:(Map.empty (module Symbol))
      ~add:(update_sym_map ( + ))
      ~remove:(update_sym_map ( - ))
val shares_per_symbol_flat :
  Order.t Core.Map.M(Order.Id).t Incr.t ->
  (Symbol.t, int, Symbol.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.t = <fun>
```

It's not as pretty, since you don't get to compose together your
existing incremental computations.  But it does perform materially
better.  Here's the result of running a benchmark containing both
approaches.

| Name   | Time/Run | mWd/Run | mjWd/Run | Prom/Run | Percentage |
|--------+----------+---------+----------+----------+------------|
| nested | 24.80us  | -1.77kw | -107.32w | -104.36w |    100.00% |
| flat   | 10.31us  | 3.55kw  | 3.42w    | 3.42w    |     41.57% |

You can find the code in `lib/incr_map/bench/shares_per_symbol.ml`,
but the cost here is for stabilizing the computation after updating
one entry in a million-order map.  (And ignore the allocation numbers
here. I'm not sure why they're crazy.)

As you can see, the flat implementation is more than twice as fast, in
addition to saving memory.

That said, in addition to making the code easier and nicer to write,
nested incrementality is often important, and as we'll see later,
there are some kinds of optimizations that are quite awkward to do
without it.

As such, you shouldn't think of nested incrementality as something to
avoid, but you should be aware of the cost, and think about how to
mitigate it. For example, if your transformation has both filtering
and transformation steps, it's often possible to arrange it so that
the the filtering happens earlier, before you need to use any of the
primed operators.  As such, you can end up doing the expensive
calculation on a small subset of the data.
