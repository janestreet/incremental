# Incremental tutorial, Part 7; Performance and Optimization

The whole point of using Incremental is to optimize your program.
This part of the tutorial will focus on providing you with some tools
for doing that optimization effectively.

To that end, we'll focus on three things: providing a basic cost
model, to help you reason about the performance of your code; to
suggest some concrete optimization techniques; and to give you some
tips for effectively measuring what's going on in an incremental
computation.

We'll start with talking about costs.

# Costs

We'll start by trying to give you some intuition for the time and
space taken by different incremental operations.  These timings are
all from native-code usages of Incremental.  The costs when compiled
to JavaScript should be expected to be higher.

**Incremental nodes are big.** One incremental node being a record of 27
fields, meaning that the record alone is 216 bytes, without even
counting the things pointed to by an incremental node.

Firing an incremental node isn't free either. It takes somewhere
between 50ns-150ns to fire a single incremental node.  The exact place
on that spectrum depends on the shape of the graph.  Linear sequences
of nodes will put you towards the bottom end.

These costs aren't huge, but they're bigger than some of the
computations you might put inside of an incremental node.  This
highlights why you shouldn't over-incrementalize; a very fine-grained
incrementalization can end up slower than a coarse grained one.

**Stabilizations, on the other hand, are nearly free.** A single
stabilization where there's nothing to be done takes under 100ns.  So
in most applications, you don't have to worry about the cost of
stabilizing too often.  (There are, however, some computational
benefits of batching updates together beyond saving the time of an
empty stabilization.  We'll discuss those later.)

Another thing worth thinking about when it comes to Incremental is
which parts of the graph are actually going to be fired.  There are
two key rules that are worth keeping in mind.

- **Only dependents of incrementals which have changed can be fired.**
  By default, a node counts as having changed if its new value is
  physically different from its previous value, but this notion of
  change can be overridden by changing the cutoff of a node.

- **Only nodes that are *necessary* will fire.** A node is necessary if
  there's some observer that transitively depends on that node.
  Merely holding on to a copy of some incremental node is not enough
  to make it run; it also has to be connected to an observer.

- **Specialized incremental data-structures further reduce firing**.
  `Incr_map.mapi'` is one example of such a specialized data structure
  that we've seen.  Notably, there, which nodes fire is
  data-dependent, rather than being strictly about node-level
  dependencies.  `Incr.Clock` and `Incr_select` provide similar
  functionality.

Note that Incremental provides a kind of best-of-both-worlds between
demand-driven and change-driven change propagation, in that only the
intersection of what is changed and what is necessary will be
recomputed.

The above does not amount to a complete cost model, but hopefully it
provides a solid starting point for thinking about the cost of an
incremental computation.

With this cost model in hand, let's explore some techniques for
improving the performance of incremental computations.

# Watching Incremental

Incremental has some built in tools for gathering metadata about
incremental computations.  You'll find these functions in the `State`
module.  For example, the following code shows you how to read out the
number of Incremental nodes that have been created thus far.

```ocaml
open Core
module Incr = Incremental.Make ()
module Incr_map = Incr_map.Make(Incr);;
open Incr.Let_syntax;;
```

```ocaml
# let _ = (Incr.State.num_nodes_created Incr.State.t : int);;
- : int = 0
# let i = Incr.Var.create 0 |> Incr.Var.watch |> Incr.map ~f:succ;;
val i : int Incr.t = <abstr>
# let _ = (Incr.State.num_nodes_created Incr.State.t : int);;
- : int = 2
```

Using these functions, we can create tool capturing and reporting
statistics about how a given incremental computation is behaving.

```ocaml
# module Stats : sig val reporter : unit -> (unit -> unit) Staged.t end = struct
    type t =
      { created : int
      ; recomputed : int
      ; changed : int
      }
    [@@deriving sexp]

    let diff t1 t2 =
      { created = t1.created - t2.created
      ; recomputed = t1.recomputed - t2.recomputed
      ; changed = t1.changed - t2.changed
      }

    let snap () =
      { created = Incr.State.num_nodes_created Incr.State.t
      ; recomputed = Incr.State.num_nodes_recomputed Incr.State.t
      ; changed = Incr.State.num_nodes_changed Incr.State.t
      }

    let reporter () =
      let open Expect_test_helpers_base in
      let old_stats = ref (snap ()) in
      let report () =
        let stats = snap () in
        print_s [%sexp (diff stats !old_stats : t)];
        old_stats := stats
      in
      stage report
  end
module Stats : sig val reporter : unit -> (unit -> unit) Staged.t end
```

We can create a stats reporter now and use it for printing out the
number of created, changed and recomputed nodes.

```ocaml
# let report = unstage (Stats.reporter ());;
val report : unit -> unit = <fun>
# let () = report ()
((created    0)
 (recomputed 0)
 (changed    0))
```

Now, let's create a small incremental computation that takes a map
full of integers and sums the squares together.

```ocaml
# let (input,sum_sq) =
    let input =
      let m = Map.of_alist_exn (module Int) (List.init 1_000 ~f:(fun x -> (x,x))) in
      Incr.Var.create m
    in
    let squares = Incr_map.mapi (Incr.Var.watch input) ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:x -> x * x) in
    let sum_sq =
      let change op ~key:_ ~data acc = op acc data in
      Incr_map.unordered_fold squares ~init:0 ~add:(change (+)) ~remove:(change (-))
    in
    (input, Incr.observe sum_sq)
val input : (int, int, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.Var.t = <abstr>
val sum_sq : int Incr.Observer.t = <abstr>
```

From reading this code, we can see three places where it looks like
incremental nodes are created, and in each case, we can guess that
just one node is created. But instead of guessing, let's run the
reporter and see.

```ocaml
# let () = report ()
((created    3)
 (recomputed 0)
 (changed    0))
```

If we now modify the input, we should see all three nodes change.

```ocaml
# let () =
    Incr.Var.set input (Map.remove (Incr.Var.value input) 100);
    Incr.stabilize ();
    report ();
((created    0)
 (recomputed 3)
 (changed    3))
```

If we use the primed version of the function for the same computation,
we'll see very different numbers.

```ocaml
# let (input,sum_sq) =
    let input =
      let m = Map.of_alist_exn (module Int) (List.init 1_000 ~f:(fun x -> (x,x))) in
      Incr.Var.create m
    in
    let squares = Incr_map.mapi' (Incr.Var.watch input) ~f:(fun ~key:_ ~data:x ->
      let%map x = x in x + 1)
    in
    let change op ~key:_ ~data acc = op acc data in
    let sum_sq =
      Incr_map.unordered_fold squares ~init:0 ~add:(change (+)) ~remove:(change (-))
      |> Incr.observe
    in
    (input,sum_sq)
val input : (int, int, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t Incr.Var.t = <abstr>
val sum_sq : int Incr.Observer.t = <abstr>
# let print () =
    Incr.stabilize ();
    print_s [%sexp (Incr.Observer.value_exn sum_sq : int)];
    report ()
val print : unit -> unit = <fun>
# let () = print ()
500500
((created    2004)
 (recomputed 2004)
 (changed    2004))
```

Here we can see that we're creating a bunch more incremental
nodes. But, when we update just one node, we'll see a small number of
recomputed and changed nodes, but no nodes created.

```ocaml
# let change f =
    Incr.Var.set input (f (Incr.Var.value input))
val change :
  ((int, int, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t ->
   (int, int, Int.comparator_witness) Map.t) ->
  unit = <fun>
# let () =
    change (fun m -> Map.set m ~key:100 ~data:101);
    print ()
500501
((created    0)
 (recomputed 6)
 (changed    5))
```

Now if we add a new key that wasn't in the map, we'll see nodes being
created as well.

```ocaml
# let () =
    change (fun m -> (Map.set m ~key:1001 ~data:1001));
    print ()
501503
((created    2)
 (recomputed 6)
 (changed    5))
```

Grabbing statistics like this from incremental is useful because it
helps you build up an intuition as to what your program is doing and
why.

Another useful tool that the `State` exposes is the ability to
generate a graph specification, suitable for display via
[dot](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/lang.html).

# Optimization tips

In this section, we'll briefly go over some useful tips for
transforming your computations to make them more efficient.

Take all of these tips with a grain of salt. These are all ways of
improving the performance of incremental computations, but they all
come with tradeoffs.  As always, you shouldn't optimize your program
blindly, but instead balance the clarity of the code against the
performance improvements you can get.

## Create fewer incrementals in the inner loop

Large incremental graphs are often fairly regular, with some core bits
of structure repeated over and over.  It's often useful to focus on
these repeated bits to try to reduce the number of incremental nodes
they contain.  This can be as simple as replacing multiple incremental
maps with a single map and ordinary function application.  e.g.,
consider the following two functions.

```ocaml
# let z x = x >>| Float.sqrt >>| Float.to_int;;
val z : float Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
# let w x = let%map x = x in Float.to_int (Float.sqrt x);;
val w : float Incr.t -> int Incr.t = <fun>
```

These two functions compute the same result, but `w` uses one less
incremental, and so is likely the better choice here.  Note that this
kind of transformation isn't always a win: if the first function often
produced the same result, and the second computation was expensive,
losing the cutoff could be a net loss.  But in this case, it's clearly
a win.

## Filter first

Complex incremental computations, especially those that use
`Incr_map`, are often organized in stages, where you have an initial
data structure that is transformed through multiple steps.  When one
of those stages filters down the data-set in a material way, it's a
good idea to put that filtering as soon as you can in the process.
That will make later stages cheaper, and, even more than computational
cost, it can do a lot to reduce the amount of memory your program
consumes.  This is especially true if some of the later stages use the
primed operators, which generate one incremental per data element.

## Flatten computations

As discussed in [Part 3](./part3-map.mdx), nested incrementality, of
the kind you get with operations like `Incr_map.mapi'`, is typically
more expensive, both in memory and in compute time, than the
flatter-style of computation when using an operation like
`Incr_map.map` or `Incr_map.unordered_fold`.

## Share sub-computations

It's common to have multiple different parts of your computation need
to reference the same incrementally computed value. When possible,
it's better to share those computations. [Part 8](./part8-sharing.mdx)
discusses this in more detail and demonstrates techniques for
achieving this sharing.

## Minimize what's necessary

Incremental will only cause the parts of the graph that are currently
*necessary* to be recomputed.  A part of the graph is *necessary* if
it's in the transitive closure of the current set of observers.  By
changing over time what's in that transitive closure to only include
the things you really need, you can effectively quiesce parts of the
computation.

This can come up in all sorts of cases.  For example, if you have a UI
with multiple different views, then if you write your code such that
non-current views are not observed, then you get to avoid paying for
maintenance of those views.

There is a cost there, however: if you're not keeping the data
associated with those out-of-sight views up to date, it does mean that
switching views can then be more expensive.

## Batch computations

While stabilizations are inexpensive, there are still good reasons to
stabilize less often.  In particular, different changes to your input
data often flow into the same parts of the computation, which means
that some work can be saved by batching up changes and stabilizing
once.  The importance of this effect is going to vary quite a bit from
computation to computation.

Note that the choice of when stabilizations are done is global across
the entire incremental graph, so this is something that you can't
really customize per computation. It's rather something that you
choose at an application level, when you construct the loop that
drives stabilization.
