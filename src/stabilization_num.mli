(** A module internal to Incremental. Users should see {!Incremental_intf}.

    A stabilization number is an int that corresponds to one round of stabilization (think
    of a round as running from the end of one stabilization to the end of the next
    stabilization). Stabilization numbers are used to detect whether a node is stale, i.e.
    if one of its children changed at a stabilization since the node was recomputed. *)
