A library for building self-adjusting computations, following the work
of [[http://www.umut-acar.org/self-adjusting-computation][Umut Acar et. al.]]. Incremental gives you a way of building complex
computations that can update efficiently in response to their inputs.
Incremental can be useful in a number of applications, including:

- Building large calculations (of the kind you might build into a
  spreadsheet) that can react efficiently to changing data.
- Constructing views in GUI applications that can incorporate new data
  efficiently.
- Building online versions of existing combinatorial algorithms.

You can find detailed documentation in of the library and how to use
it in [[https://github.com/janestreet/incremental/blob/master/src/incremental_intf.ml][incremental/src/incremental_intf.ml]].  You can also find an
informal introduction to the library in this [[https://blog.janestreet.com/introducing-incremental][blog post]].
